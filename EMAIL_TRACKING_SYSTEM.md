# Email Tracking System Documentation

## Overview
This system tracks user engagement with cart abandonment emails, including opens, clicks, and conversions.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
Added new tracking columns to `cart_abandonment_log` table:
- `email_opened` (BOOLEAN) - Whether email was opened
- `link_clicked` (BOOLEAN) - Whether "Complete Your Purchase" button was clicked
- `purchase_completed` (BOOLEAN) - Whether user completed the purchase
- `opened_at` (TIMESTAMP) - When email was opened
- `clicked_at` (TIMESTAMP) - When link was clicked
- `completed_at` (TIMESTAMP) - When purchase was completed
- `click_count` (INT) - Number of times user clicked the email link

### 2. Email Tracking Pixel
- **Location**: Embedded at the bottom of every abandonment email
- **Endpoint**: `/track/email/<log_id>`
- **Method**: 1x1 transparent GIF image
- **Trigger**: Automatically loaded when email is opened in most email clients
- **Action**: Updates `email_opened = TRUE` and sets `opened_at` timestamp

### 3. Click Tracking
- **Method**: URL parameters added to cart URL
- **Format**: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/cart?email_track=<log_id>&source=abandonment_email`
- **Trigger**: When user clicks "Complete Your Purchase Now" button
- **Action**: 
  - Updates `link_clicked = TRUE`
  - Sets `clicked_at` timestamp
  - Increments `click_count`

### 4. Conversion Tracking
- **Trigger**: When user completes checkout after clicking from abandonment email
- **Logic**: Updates most recent abandonment email (within 7 days) for the user
- **Action**:
  - Updates `purchase_completed = TRUE`
  - Sets `completed_at` timestamp

### 5. Admin Dashboard Display
The admin dashboard now shows:
- âœ… **Email**: Recipient email address
- ðŸ’° **Cart Value**: Total value of abandoned cart
- ðŸ“… **Sent At**: Timestamp when email was sent
- ðŸŽ¯ **Status**: Dynamic badge showing:
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Converted** (green) - User completed purchase
  - ðŸ”µ **Clicked** (blue) - User clicked link but didn't purchase
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Opened** (yellow) - User opened email but didn't click
  - âš« **Sent** (gray) - Email sent but not yet opened

## Technical Implementation

### Email Generation Flow
1. Cart abandonment detected
2. Log entry created in database â†’ returns `log_id`
3. Email content generated with tracking parameters:
   - Tracking pixel URL: `BASE_URL/track/email/{log_id}`
   - Cart URL: `CART_URL?email_track={log_id}&source=abandonment_email`
4. Email sent with embedded tracking
5. Log entry updated with `email_sent = TRUE`

### Tracking Flow

#### Email Open Tracking
```
User opens email 
  â†’ Email client loads tracking pixel
  â†’ GET /track/email/<log_id>
  â†’ Database updated: email_opened=TRUE, opened_at=NOW()
  â†’ Returns 1x1 transparent GIF
```

#### Click Tracking
```
User clicks "Complete Your Purchase Now"
  â†’ Redirects to /cart?email_track=<log_id>
  â†’ Database updated: link_clicked=TRUE, clicked_at=NOW(), click_count++
  â†’ User sees their cart
```

#### Conversion Tracking
```
User completes checkout
  â†’ System finds most recent abandonment email (within 7 days)
  â†’ Database updated: purchase_completed=TRUE, completed_at=NOW()
  â†’ Cart cleared, order created
```

## Key Files Modified

### 1. `cart_abandonment_detector.py`
- `_ensure_tracking_table()`: Added new tracking columns
- `generate_email_content()`: Added `log_id` parameter, tracking URL generation
- `_build_email_html()`: Added tracking pixel to email HTML
- `check_abandoned_carts()`: Modified to log event first, then send email with log_id
- `_log_abandonment_event()`: Returns `log_id` for tracking

### 2. `app.py`
- **Imports**: Added `make_response` for pixel response
- **Cart Route** (`/cart`): Added click tracking logic
- **Checkout Route** (`/checkout`): Added conversion tracking logic
- **New Route** (`/track/email/<log_id>`): Handles email open tracking with 1x1 GIF pixel
- **Admin Dashboard**: Updated query to fetch all tracking fields

### 3. `config.py`
- Uses existing `BASE_URL` for tracking pixel URL generation

## Metrics Available

### Individual Email Metrics
- **Open Rate**: Whether specific email was opened
- **Click Rate**: Whether user clicked the CTA button
- **Conversion Rate**: Whether user completed purchase
- **Click Count**: How many times user clicked
- **Time to Open**: `opened_at - sent_at`
- **Time to Click**: `clicked_at - sent_at`
- **Time to Convert**: `completed_at - sent_at`

### Aggregate Metrics (Future Enhancement)
Can be calculated from database:
- Overall open rate: `(emails_opened / emails_sent) * 100`
- Overall click-through rate: `(emails_clicked / emails_sent) * 100`
- Overall conversion rate: `(purchases_completed / emails_sent) * 100`
- Average time to conversion
- Revenue recovered from abandonment emails

## Privacy & Compliance Notes

### Email Open Tracking Limitations
- **Mail Privacy Protection** (Apple Mail): May pre-fetch images, causing false opens
- **Email clients with images disabled**: Won't track opens
- **Privacy-focused email clients**: May block tracking pixels

### Best Practices
- Tracking is anonymous (tied to log_id, not exposed user data)
- No personally identifiable information in tracking URLs
- Compliant with GDPR (operational tracking, not behavioral profiling)
- Users can opt out via unsubscribe link (future enhancement)

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Analytics Dashboard
- Add `/admin/email-analytics` route
- Charts showing:
  - Open rates over time
  - Click-through rates
  - Conversion funnel visualization
  - Revenue recovered

### 2. A/B Testing
- Test different subject lines
- Test different discount percentages
- Test different email designs
- Store variant info in database

### 3. Advanced Metrics
- Time-to-conversion analysis
- Multi-touch attribution (if user received multiple emails)
- Device/client detection from tracking requests
- Geographic location from IP (if needed)

### 4. Automated Reporting
- Daily/weekly email reports to admin
- Performance summaries
- Top-performing email campaigns

## Testing the System

### Test Email Open Tracking
1. Send abandonment email to test user
2. Open email in mail client
3. Check admin dashboard - status should show "Opened" badge
4. Check database: `email_opened=1`, `opened_at` timestamp set

### Test Click Tracking
1. Open abandonment email
2. Click "Complete Your Purchase Now" button
3. Verify redirect to cart with tracking parameters
4. Check admin dashboard - status should show "Clicked" badge
5. Check database: `link_clicked=1`, `clicked_at` timestamp, `click_count=1`

### Test Conversion Tracking
1. Click email link
2. Proceed to checkout
3. Complete order
4. Check admin dashboard - status should show "Converted" badge
5. Check database: `purchase_completed=1`, `completed_at` timestamp

## Database Query Examples

### Get all tracking metrics
```sql
SELECT 
    cal.id,
    u.email,
    cal.cart_total,
    cal.email_sent,
    cal.email_opened,
    cal.link_clicked,
    cal.purchase_completed,
    cal.click_count,
    cal.created_at,
    cal.opened_at,
    cal.clicked_at,
    cal.completed_at,
    TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, cal.created_at, cal.opened_at) as minutes_to_open,
    TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, cal.created_at, cal.clicked_at) as minutes_to_click,
    TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, cal.created_at, cal.completed_at) as minutes_to_convert
FROM cart_abandonment_log cal
JOIN users u ON cal.user_id = u.id
WHERE cal.email_sent = TRUE
ORDER BY cal.created_at DESC;
```

### Calculate overall metrics
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_emails,
    SUM(email_opened) as emails_opened,
    SUM(link_clicked) as emails_clicked,
    SUM(purchase_completed) as purchases_completed,
    ROUND((SUM(email_opened) / COUNT(*)) * 100, 2) as open_rate,
    ROUND((SUM(link_clicked) / COUNT(*)) * 100, 2) as click_rate,
    ROUND((SUM(purchase_completed) / COUNT(*)) * 100, 2) as conversion_rate,
    SUM(CASE WHEN purchase_completed = TRUE THEN cart_total ELSE 0 END) as revenue_recovered
FROM cart_abandonment_log
WHERE email_sent = TRUE;
```

## System Requirements
- Flask with `make_response` support (already included)
- MySQL/MariaDB with timestamp support
