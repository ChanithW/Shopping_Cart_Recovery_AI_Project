```sql
SELECT

    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    COUNT(c.id) as items_count,
    SUM(p.price * c.quantity) as cart_value,
    MAX(c.updated_at) as last_updated,
    TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, MAX(c.updated_at), NOW()) as minutes_ago
FROM cart c
JOIN users u ON c.user_id = u.id
JOIN products p ON c.product_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.user_id = o.user_id
    AND o.created_at > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
WHERE o.id IS NULL
AND c.updated_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 MINUTE)
GROUP BY c.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email
ORDER BY cart_value DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Email Campaign Tracking

## Accessing the Feature

1. **Login to Admin:** `http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin`

3. **Time Since Last Activity** - Urgency indicator
4. **Email Performance:**
   - Send rate
   - Open rate
   - Click rate
   - Conversion rate

## Future Enhancements (Planned)

- [ ] Filter abandoned carts by date range
- [ ] Export abandoned carts to CSV
- [ ] Manual email trigger button
- [ ] Email preview/edit before sending
- [ ] Conversion funnel visualization
- [ ] Revenue recovery chart
- [ ] Customer segmentation

## Technical Notes

- **Auto-Refresh:** Dashboard requires manual page refresh
- **Limit:** Shows top 10 abandoned carts (highest value first)
- **Performance:** Queries optimized with proper indexes
- **Caching:** Consider adding Redis for high-traffic sites

## Troubleshooting

**No abandoned carts showing:**

- Check if users have items in cart
- Verify cart hasn't been updated in last minute
- Ensure no orders placed in last 24 hours
- Check database connection

**Emails not tracked:**

- Verify `cart_abandonment_log` table exists
- Check email sending is successful
- Review logs: `logs/cart_abandonment.log`
