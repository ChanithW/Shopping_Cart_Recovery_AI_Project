# 🎯 What to Do After Running Tests

## ✅ Tests Passed! Now What?

You've successfully tested the cart abandonment system. Here's your step-by-step guide to get it running:

---

## 📋 **Quick Checklist**

- [x] Install dependencies (google-generativeai, scikit-learn, numpy, flask-mail)
- [x] Run tests successfully
- [x] Sample email generated
- [ ] **View sample email**
- [ ] **Integrate with Flask app** (DONE automatically!)
- [ ] **(Optional) Add Gemini API key**
- [ ] **Start your Flask server**
- [ ] **Test with real cart**

---

## Step 1: View the Sample Email 📧

**Quick Command:**
```powershell
start sample_abandonment_email.html
```

Or manually open:
```
C:\AI_Agent_LLM&NLP\Ecom_platform\ecom\cart_abandonment_detector\sample_abandonment_email.html
```

**What You'll See:**
- Beautiful HTML email layout
- 20% discount badge (cart was $1,059.97)
- Free shipping notification
- Cart summary table
- Product recommendation cards
- Big green "Return to Cart" button
- Mobile-responsive design

---

## Step 2: Integration (Already Done! ✅)

I've already integrated the detector into your `app.py`. It will:
- ✅ Start automatically when you run your Flask server
- ✅ Run in background thread (won't block your app)
- ✅ Check for abandoned carts every 30 seconds
- ✅ Send emails automatically

**You don't need to do anything else!** Just start your server.

---

## Step 3: (Optional) Add Gemini API Key 🤖

For AI-powered personalized email content:

**Get Your Free API Key:**
1. Visit: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Copy the key

**Add to .env:**
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

**Without Gemini:**
- System still works perfectly
- Uses fallback template text
- All other features work (discounts, recommendations, emails)

**With Gemini:**
- Emails have AI-generated personalized text
- More engaging and human-like
- Higher conversion rates

---

## Step 4: Start Your Flask Server 🚀

**Start the server:**
```powershell
cd C:\AI_Agent_LLM&NLP\Ecom_platform\ecom
python app.py
```

**What You'll See:**
```
* Serving Flask app 'app'
* Debug mode: on
✅ Cart Abandonment Detector started in background
WARNING: This is a development server...
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

**The detector is now running!** 🎉

---

## Step 5: Test with a Real Cart 🛒

### **Create a Test Abandoned Cart:**

1. **Open your site:**
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8080
   ```

2. **Login as a test user** (not admin)

3. **Add items to cart** (at least $100 for discount)

4. **Leave the cart** (don't checkout)

5. **Wait 1 minute**

6. **Check your email!** 📧

### **Expected Flow:**
```
0:00 - Add to cart ($150 worth)
1:00 - Detector finds abandoned cart
1:00 - Calculates 10% discount
1:01 - Generates recommendations (TF-IDF)
1:02 - Generates email (with AI if key set)
1:03 - Email sent! ✉️
```

### **What Email You'll Get:**
- Subject: "🛒 [Your Name], you left something in your cart! + 10% OFF!"
- 10% discount ($15 savings)
- Free shipping
- 3 recommended products
- Personalized content
- "Return to Cart" button

---

## Step 6: Monitor the System 📊

### **Check Logs:**
```powershell
# View real-time logs
Get-Content logs\cart_abandonment.log -Wait
```

**What You'll See:**
```
2025-10-08 19:49:27,582 - INFO - Gemini AI initialized successfully
2025-10-08 19:49:27,586 - INFO - Loaded 8 products for recommendations
2025-10-08 19:49:28,241 - INFO - Generated email for john@example.com - Cart: $1059.97, Discount: 20%
2025-10-08 19:49:28,500 - INFO - Email sent successfully to john@example.com
```

### **Check Database:**
```sql
-- View abandonment events
SELECT * FROM cart_abandonment_log ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- See who got emails
SELECT 
    u.name, u.email, 
    cal.cart_total, 
    cal.email_sent, 
    cal.created_at
FROM cart_abandonment_log cal
JOIN users u ON cal.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY cal.created_at DESC;
```

---

## 🎛️ Configuration (Optional)

### **For Testing (Current Settings):**
```python
ABANDONMENT_THRESHOLD_MINUTES = 1    # Fast for testing
CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 30          # Check frequently
```

### **For Production (Recommended):**

Edit `cart_abandonment_detector/config.py`:
```python
ABANDONMENT_THRESHOLD_MINUTES = 30   # More realistic
CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 300         # Every 5 minutes
```

### **Discount Tiers:**
```python
DISCOUNT_TIER_1_AMOUNT = 100   # $100+ → 10% off
DISCOUNT_TIER_2_AMOUNT = 500   # $500+ → 20% off
```

**Adjust these based on:**
- Your profit margins
- Average cart value
- Conversion rate goals

---

## 🔧 Advanced: Manual Trigger (for Testing)

Add this route to your `app.py` for manual testing:

```python
@app.route('/admin/trigger-abandonment-check')
def trigger_abandonment_check():
    """Manual trigger for testing (admin only)"""
    if not is_logged_in() or not is_admin():
        return jsonify({'error': 'Unauthorized'}), 403
    
    import asyncio
    
    async def check():
        await cart_detector.check_abandoned_carts()
    
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    loop.run_until_complete(check())
    loop.close()
    
    return jsonify({
        'status': 'success', 
        'message': 'Abandonment check triggered'
    })
```

**Use it:**
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin/trigger-abandonment-check
```

This immediately checks for abandoned carts without waiting for the 30-second interval.

## 📈 Tracking Performance

### **Key Metrics to Monitor:**

1. **Abandonment Rate:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       COUNT(*) as total_carts,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN email_sent THEN 1 END) as emails_sent,
       ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN email_sent THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as email_rate
   FROM cart_abandonment_log;
   ```

2. **Average Cart Value:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       AVG(cart_total) as avg_cart,
       MIN(cart_total) as min_cart,
       MAX(cart_total) as max_cart
   FROM cart_abandonment_log;
   ```

3. **Discount Distribution:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       CASE 
           WHEN cart_total >= 500 THEN '20% tier ($500+)'
           WHEN cart_total >= 100 THEN '10% tier ($100-499)'
           ELSE 'No discount (<$100)'
       END as tier,
       COUNT(*) as count,
       AVG(cart_total) as avg_cart
   FROM cart_abandonment_log
   GROUP BY tier;
   ```

4. **Recovery Rate** (requires order tracking):
   ```sql
   -- Check if users completed purchase after email
   SELECT 
       cal.user_id,
       cal.cart_total,
       cal.created_at as email_sent_at,
       o.created_at as order_created_at,
       o.total_amount
   FROM cart_abandonment_log cal
   LEFT JOIN orders o ON cal.user_id = o.user_id 
       AND o.created_at > cal.created_at
   WHERE cal.email_sent = TRUE;
   ```

## ✨ What Happens Automatically

Once your server is running, the system automatically:

1. **Every 30 seconds:**
   - Queries database for abandoned carts
   - Identifies users who haven't checked out

2. **For each abandoned cart:**
   - Calculates total and discount tier
   - Generates 3 product recommendations (TF-IDF)
   - Creates personalized email (with Gemini if key set)
   - Sends email asynchronously
   - Logs event to database

3. **Prevents duplicates:**
   - Tracks sent emails in memory
   - Won't send same user multiple emails for same cart

4. **Handles errors gracefully:**
   - Falls back to template text if Gemini fails
   - Continues if one email fails
   - Logs all errors for debugging

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **No Emails Sending?**

**Check 1: Email Configuration**
```powershell
# Verify .env has correct settings
Get-Content .env | Select-String "MAIL"
```

Should show:
```
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```

**Check 2: Logs**
```powershell
Get-Content logs\cart_abandonment.log -Tail 50
```

Look for:
```
ERROR - Failed to send email to user@example.com: ...
```

**Check 3: Test Email Manually**
```python
# In Python shell
from flask_mail import Mail, Message
from app import app, mail

with app.app_context():
    msg = Message('Test', recipients=['your_email@example.com'])
    msg.body = 'Test email'
    mail.send(msg)
```

### **Recommendations Not Working?**

**Issue:** "Generated 0 recommendations"

**Fix:**
1. Ensure products have descriptions in database
2. Lower similarity threshold in `config.py`:
   ```python
   SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.05  # Lower = more recommendations
   ```

### **Gemini API Errors?**

**Error:** "404 models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found"

**Causes:**
- API key not set or invalid
- No internet connection
- API quota exceeded

**Fix:**
- System works fine without Gemini
- Uses fallback template text
- All other features work normally
