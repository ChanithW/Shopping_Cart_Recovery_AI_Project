# Dynamic Recommendation Strategy Implementation

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

### **What Changed:**
Implemented dynamic recommendation count that scales with cart size instead of using a fixed number.

---

## 📊 Recommendation Strategy

### **Small Carts (1-3 items): 3-5 recommendations**
| Cart Items | Recommendations | Logic |
|------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 item | 3 | Minimum of 3 |
| 2 items | 4 | 2 × 2 = 4 |
| 3 items | 5 | 3 × 2 = 6, capped at 5 |

### **Medium Carts (4-8 items): 5-8 recommendations**
| Cart Items | Recommendations | Logic |
|------------|-----------------|-------|
| 4 items | 5 | Minimum of 5 |
| 5 items | 5 | Matches cart size |
| 6 items | 6 | Matches cart size |
| 7 items | 7 | Matches cart size |
| 8 items | 8 | Matches cart size |

### **Large Carts (8+ items): 8-10 recommendations**
| Cart Items | Recommendations | Logic |
|------------|-----------------|-------|
| 9 items | 9 | Matches cart size |
| 10 items | 10 | Matches cart size, max |
| 12 items | 10 | Capped at 10 |
| 15+ items | 10 | Capped at 10 |

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **File Modified:**
`cart_abandonment_detector/cart_abandonment_detector.py`

### **Location:**
Lines 533-544 in `generate_email_content()` method

### **Code Added:**
```python
# Dynamic recommendation count based on cart size
cart_size = len(cart_items)

if cart_size <= 3:
    # Small carts (1-3 items): 3-5 recommendations
    dynamic_count = min(5, max(3, cart_size * 2))
elif cart_size <= 8:
    # Medium carts (4-8 items): 5-8 recommendations
    dynamic_count = min(8, max(5, cart_size))
else:
    # Large carts (8+ items): 8-10 recommendations
    dynamic_count = min(10, max(8, cart_size))

logger.info(f"Cart size: {cart_size} items → Generating {dynamic_count} recommendations")

# Get product recommendations with dynamic count
recommendations = self.recommendation_engine.get_similar_products(
    cart_items,
    count=dynamic_count
)
```

### **Old Code (Removed):**
```python
# Get product recommendations
recommendations = self.recommendation_engine.get_similar_products(
    cart_items,
    count=config.RECOMMENDATION_COUNT  # Fixed at 5
)
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### **1. Better User Experience**
- **Small carts:** Not overwhelmed with too many recommendations
- **Medium carts:** Balanced suggestions
- **Large carts:** More options to explore

### **2. Scalability**
- Automatically adjusts to any cart size
- No manual configuration needed
- Works for edge cases (very large carts)

### **3. Higher Engagement**
- Relevant number of suggestions
- Matches user's shopping intent
- Prevents decision paralysis

## 📈 Impact on Your 8-Item Cart

### **Before:**
- Cart: 8 items
- Recommendations: **5 items** (fixed)
- Ratio: 62.5% of cart size

### **After:**
- Cart: 8 items
- Recommendations: **8 items** (dynamic)
- Ratio: 100% of cart size

**You now get 3 more recommendations (60% increase)!**

## 🧪 Test Results

```
✅ All cart size ranges tested and verified
✅ Small carts: 3-5 recommendations ✓
✅ Medium carts: 5-8 recommendations ✓
✅ Large carts: 8-10 recommendations ✓
```

### **Example Outputs:**
```
Cart size: 1 items → Generating 3 recommendations
Cart size: 2 items → Generating 4 recommendations
Cart size: 3 items → Generating 5 recommendations
Cart size: 4 items → Generating 5 recommendations
Cart size: 5 items → Generating 5 recommendations
Cart size: 6 items → Generating 6 recommendations
Cart size: 7 items → Generating 7 recommendations
Cart size: 8 items → Generating 8 recommendations ⭐ (Your case!)
Cart size: 10 items → Generating 10 recommendations
Cart size: 15 items → Generating 10 recommendations (capped)
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### **Logic Flow:**
```
User's Cart
    ↓
Count items: cart_size = 8
    ↓
Check category: 4-8 items = Medium cart
    ↓
Calculate: min(8, max(5, 8)) = 8
    ↓
Generate 8 TF-IDF recommendations
    ↓
Balanced by category (electronics/furniture/etc)
    ↓
Email shows 8 relevant product suggestions
```

### **Category Balancing Still Active:**
The recommendations are still balanced by category as before:
- If you have 5 electronics + 3 furniture → ~5 electronics + ~3 furniture recommendations
- Proportional distribution maintained

---

## 📝 Monitoring

### **Logs to Watch:**
```bash
# When cart abandonment email is generated:
INFO - Cart size: 8 items → Generating 8 recommendations
INFO - Cart categories: {'electronics': 5, 'furniture': 3}, Recommendation quotas: {'electronics': 5, 'furniture': 3}
```

### **Verify It's Working:**
1. Add 8 items to cart
2. Wait for abandonment email
3. Check email - should show 8 recommendations
4. Check server logs - should see dynamic count calculation

---

## 🔄 To Activate

### **Restart Server:**
```powershell
cd "C:\AI_Agent_LLM&NLP\Ecom_platform\ecom"
python app.py
```

### **Test:**
1. Add different numbers of items to cart
2. Trigger abandonment
3. Verify recommendation counts match strategy

## ✅ Summary

**Before:**
- Fixed: 5 recommendations for all carts

**After:**
- Dynamic: 3-10 recommendations based on cart size
- Your 8-item cart: **8 recommendations** (was 5)
- Better user experience
- More relevant suggestions

**The recommendation system now intelligently scales with your shopping cart!** 🎉
