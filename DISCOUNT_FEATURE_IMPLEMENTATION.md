# Discount Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete discount system that applies promotional discounts when users click the "Complete your purchase now" button from cart abandonment emails.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Database Migration ✅
**File**: `migrations/add_discount_to_cart_abandonment_log.sql`
- Added `discount_offered` column to `cart_abandonment_log` table
- Column type: `DECIMAL(5,2)` (stores percentages like 10.00, 20.00)
- Default value: 0
- Migration successfully applied

### 2. Cart Abandonment Detector ✅
**File**: `cart_abandonment_detector/cart_abandonment_detector.py`

**Changes**:
- Modified `_log_abandonment_event()` to accept and store `discount_percent` parameter
- Updated abandonment detection logic to calculate discount before logging event
- Modified tracking URL to include discount parameter: `?email_track={log_id}&discount={discount_percent}&source=abandonment_email`

**Discount Tiers** (from `config.py`):
```python
Cart Total       Discount
-----------      --------
$100 - $499      10%
$500+            20%
< $100           0%
```

### 3. Cart Route ✅
**File**: `app.py` - `/cart` route

**Changes**:
- Retrieves discount percentage from `cart_abandonment_log` when user clicks email link
- Stores discount in session (`session['discount_percent']` and `session['discount_log_id']`)
- Calculates discount amount: `discount_amount = total_amount * (discount_percent / 100)`
- Passes discount variables to template:
  - `discount_percent`: Percentage (e.g., 10, 20)
  - `discount_amount`: Dollar amount deducted
  - `final_total`: Total after discount

### 4. Cart Template ✅
**File**: `templates/cart.html`

**Changes**:
- Added conditional discount row (shown only if `discount_percent > 0`)
- Displays discount with tag icon: `🏷️ Discount (10%): -$50.00`
- Updated total to show `final_total` when discount is applied
- Green color for discount to highlight savings

**Display**:
```
Subtotal:     $500.00
Shipping:     Free
Discount (10%): -$50.00
─────────────────────
Total:        $450.00
```

### 5. Checkout Route ✅
**File**: `app.py` - `/checkout` route

**Changes**:
- Retrieves discount from session (persisted from cart page)
- Calculates final total with discount applied
- Saves order with discounted price: `total_amount = final_total`
- Tracks conversion with specific `discount_log_id` from session
- Clears discount from session after successful purchase
- Passes discount variables to template

### 6. Checkout Template ✅
**File**: `templates/checkout.html`

**Changes**:
- Added conditional discount row (same styling as cart)
- Shows discount percentage and amount
- Displays final total with discount applied
- Matches cart.html styling for consistency

### 7. Admin Dashboard ✅
**File**: `app.py` - `/admin` route

**Changes**:
- Updated query to use `cal.discount_offered` instead of hardcoded `15`
- Dashboard now shows actual discount percentage offered in each email
- Tracks discount effectiveness per abandonment email

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **Cart Abandonment Detected**
   - System detects cart idle for 1+ minute
   - Calculates discount based on cart total (0%, 10%, or 20%)
   - Stores discount in `cart_abandonment_log.discount_offered`

2. **Email Sent**
   - Email shows discounted price: `$1,000 → $800 (20% OFF)`
   - "Complete Your Purchase Now" button includes discount in URL
   - URL: `/cart?email_track=123&discount=20&source=abandonment_email`

3. **User Clicks Button**
   - App retrieves discount from database via `email_track` ID
   - Stores discount in session for persistence
   - Cart page shows discount breakdown

4. **Cart Page Display**
   ```
   Subtotal:        $1,000.00
   Shipping:        Free
   Discount (20%):  -$200.00
   ─────────────────────────
   Total:           $800.00
   ```

5. **Checkout Page**
   - Discount persists from session
   - Same breakdown shown
   - Order total includes discount
